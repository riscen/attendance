calendar: Table, each cell represents a day in the calendar. Dynamic component.

Process
At component mount:
    Ask for holidays (response is an object)
    Ask for employee calendars (response is an array)

After getting both data fill calendar and its controls.

Add two future calendars in calendars response.
Each calendar should have a boolean field: readonly
    if is true then the calendar is not editable
    else can be edited

The only months editable are:
    first past month
    actual month
    future months

Change calendarControls to arrows and not dropdowns. Is easier for user and for calculations
